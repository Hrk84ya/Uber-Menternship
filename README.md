# Traffic Analysis and Prediction System

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze traffic patterns and predict future traffic conditions using machine learning. The system processes traffic data, performs exploratory data analysis, identifies peak hours, and builds predictive models to forecast traffic conditions.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines multiple data sources including traffic data, weather information, and special events
- **Peak Hour Analysis**: Identifies and visualizes traffic patterns and peak hours
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements XGBoost for traffic prediction
- **Feature Importance**: Uses SHAP values to explain model predictions
- **Visualization**: Generates various plots and charts for data exploration and model evaluation
